# Fusion360 Model to URDF Updated with IA (Under Developing)
 
Fusion360 models to URDF Plugin Updated with IA (Fusion360 2025)

The goal of this system is to optimize the time and algorithm not only for robotics, but to transform any type of 3D model from Fusion360 (F3d) to URDF with .dae files (with Alternative Textures) or .stl files such as Houses, Buildings, so that they can later be rendered in the Cloud in services like Google Colab (a system in which I have worked hard).

Furthermore, the code was enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (specifically with Chat GPT-5.1).

Based on the efforts of this robotics gentleman
